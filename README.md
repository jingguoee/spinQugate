# Spin Quantum Gate Lab
Spin Quantum Gate Lab is a set of python codes that calculate the device-level characteristics of spin-based quantum gates. Single-qubit rotational gates and two-qubit controlled-phase gate can be simulated, which form a complete set of quantum gates for universal quantum computing. The tool can simulate time evolution, compute delay and fidelity, and perform quantum process tomography for the quantum gates. The effect of dephasing can be simulated by inputting a spin dephasing time.

An online simulation tool of SpinQugate Lab is avaialbe at nanoHub [https://nanohub.org/resources/spinqugate](https://nanohub.org/resources/spinqugate).

# Examples
Examples of using the code to simulate Quantum Gates are available at [https://nanohub.org/resources/spinqugate/supportingdocs].
